Short fishing prototype game made in an effort to learn the Godot game engine. 

The gameplay is pretty simple and only uses the mouse. Left click on the spawning shrinking circles to cast your line.

To reel in the fish, you must left click again anywhere on the screen, and time the moving circle to beside the stationary one.

You will randomly collect a variety of fish and/or objects, each with a dollar value, get over $100 worth of items to win.

Overall a pretty enjoyable process, though admittedly I completely mis-understood/screwed up the UI when creating this, which is why it plays in such a small screen. It doesn't scale, so it's locked at it's small resolution, and I think fixing it would require re-building it again. 

Honestly, I'm just putting this out for documentation/portfolio purposes, it's really not worth playing, ideally my next project will be a lot better.
